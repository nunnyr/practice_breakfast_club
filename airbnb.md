## Deliverables

You are building an app for an Airbnb competitor

- your models are listings, guests, trips
  - a listing (i.e. a house or apartment) has many trips
    - a listing has a city attribute which is a string of a city name, e.g. 'Seattle'
  - a guest has many trips
  - a trip belongs to a listing and a guest

Write out the relationships using has_many, belongs_to and has_many_through.
Create the necessary methods to connect these classes.
